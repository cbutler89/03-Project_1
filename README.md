About: Project 1
==================

A collaborative effort with Sam Kuo and Jon Gorr to design and print multiple connecting objects, whose function revolves around a found object. Our found object was dirt. We chose to create a decorative, artificial flower pot. Jon designed a pot to hold the dirt. Sam and I designed an artificial plant to be proped up in the dirt. Sam made the large stem, and I made the flower that is fitted onto the stem. 
Printed in PLA.
